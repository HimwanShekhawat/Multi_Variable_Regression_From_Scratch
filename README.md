# Multivariable Linear Regression (From Scratch)

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of multivariable linear regression using gradient descent. The objective is to fit a linear model on synthetic data with three features to predict a continuous target variable.

## Features

- Generates random training data with three features.
- Applies a known linear model with added Gaussian noise.
- Implements gradient descent manually.
- Tracks and visualizes the cost function over iterations.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

## Usage

1. Load the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Run all cells to visualize training data, fit the model, and view cost optimization.
3. Inspect weight updates and model performance manually.
