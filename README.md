# Multi_Variable_Regression_From_Scratch
Implements multivariable linear regression using gradient descent. Generates synthetic data with 3 features, fits a model to predict output, and tracks error over time. Visualizes training data and cost curve to show model learning progress. All logic is built from scratch using NumPy.
